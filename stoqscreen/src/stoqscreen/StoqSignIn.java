 * 		--S Suggestion from developer
 * 
 * 
 * This section needs to start first when stoqscreen is launched. 
 * 		--Q Should we have a sign in section or will stoqscreen be for guest users?
 *		--Q What the hell should we name it?
 *		--S I have this idea of whenever a user adds a stock to "track" the ticker
 *			is written to a file inside of the program directory. Stoqscreen then 
 *			reads the file and retrieves the data from this master "user" file.
